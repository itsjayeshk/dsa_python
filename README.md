# 🧠 DSA Programs in Python

All Python programs completed as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey.




## 📁 Folder Structure

```bash
dsa-python-tasks/
├── phase1_basics/           # Task 1–25 (Arrays, Loops, Digits, etc.)
├── phase2_matrices/         # Task 26–50 (2D Arrays, Matrices)
├── phase3_recursion/        # Task 51-80(Recursion, LeetCode Easy )
├── phase4_leetcode/         # Task 81 onwards (To be created soon)
└── README.md

## 🔧 How to Use

- Each file is named according to its task, e.g., `task03_min_element.py`
- Run files individually to test logic
- Most programs use `input()` — be ready to enter values during execution

## 🚀 What's Next

- ✅ Completed Phase 1,Phase 2 and Phase 3
- 🔜 Start **Phase 4: LeetCode Easy** on **15th July 2025**
- 📌 Future plans:
  - Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming
  - System Design + AI/ML Projects (2026+)
